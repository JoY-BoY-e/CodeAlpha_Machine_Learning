# CodeAlpha Internship Submission

This repository serves as the main submission point for my project-based internship at **CodeAlpha**. It is organized using Git submodules to encapsulate two independent machine learning projects, each corresponding to an assigned internship task.

## Repository Structure

- `task1` — [Credit Scoring Model](https://github.com/JoY-BoY-e/Credit_Scoring_Model)
  - Implements a machine learning model for credit scoring.
  - Contains all code and documentation relevant to the credit scoring use case.
- `task2` — [ML-Audio Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/JoY-BoY-e/ML-Audio_Emotion_Recognition)
  - Implements an audio-based emotion recognition system using machine learning.
  - Includes datasets, model code, and relevant files for audio emotion detection.

## How to Use

This repository uses Git submodules.  
To clone along with the submodules, use:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JoY-BoY-e/CodeAlpha_Machine_Learning.git
```

Or, if already cloned, initialize and update submodules with:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Each task directory contains its own README and instructions.

## Purpose

This repo aggregates and submits my internship work for CodeAlpha, ensuring modular organization and traceability for each project:

- **Task 1:** Credit scoring using machine learning.
- **Task 2:** Audio-based emotion recognition using machine learning.

For details on each project, refer to the respective submodule directories.
